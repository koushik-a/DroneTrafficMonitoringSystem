# DroneTrafficMonitoringSystem
This is a IOT based prototype that can be attached on to any drone that can carry 40 grams of payload. This will help us track the drone while in air and to get live data from drone which is similar to functionality of regular ADS-B system.
This code is developed in a c based language (.ino) for arduino uno
